All files placed in this directory will be accessible at `/files/my-file.ppt`. 

Why? In order to separate site assets (such as logo.png, header-image12.jpg) from downloadable assets (such as presentation.ppt)

This file also exists to ensure that this directory is created when doing a `git clone`.
